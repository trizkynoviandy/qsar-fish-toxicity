# Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship of Fish Toxicity

This project aims to analyze the quantitative structure-activity relationship to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) on a set of 908 chemicals. The method used are the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)


## Variables used are:

* CIC0
* SM1_Dz(Z)
* GATS1i
* NdsCH
* NdssC
* MLOGP
* Target variables, LC50 \[-LOG(mol/L)]
